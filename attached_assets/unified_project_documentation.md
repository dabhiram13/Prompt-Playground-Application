# Unified Project Documentation

## Project Requirements Document

### 1. Project Overview

This project is a Prompt Engineering Playbook delivered as an interactive website. Its purpose is to teach both beginners and experienced AI practitioners, as well as technical writers, how to craft, refine, and optimize prompts for AI models. By walking through a structured set of techniques, examples, and case studies, the playbook makes prompt engineering approachable and practical.

The key objectives are to present a clear library of prompting techniques, provide step-by-step examples that show real improvements, and demonstrate the impact with before/after case studies. Success means readers can quickly find and apply the right technique, understand why each change matters, and refer back to an up-to-date online guide without needing downloads. It’s being built to centralize best practices, encourage consistency in AI interactions, and allow continuous updates through GitHub collaboration.

### 2. In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

In-Scope:

*   Interactive website hosted on GitHub Pages
*   Sections: Introduction, Techniques, Step-by-Step Examples, Case Studies, Conclusions
*   Collapsible panels for techniques and side-by-side before/after comparisons
*   Search and indexing powered by Lunr.js
*   Feedback integration with Disqus and analytics via Google Analytics
*   Responsive design with neutral blue/gray palette and sans-serif fonts
*   PDF download of the current playbook version
*   Version control workflow on GitHub, editable via Replit

Out-of-Scope:

*   User accounts, sign-in gates, or membership tiers
*   Live sandbox for executing prompts against a running AI model
*   Custom backend or server-side API beyond static hosting
*   Third-party branding beyond simple logo placement
*   Offline-first application beyond PDF download

### 3. User Flow

When a user lands on the site, they see a clean header with a logo at top-left, a navigation bar, and a welcome banner explaining the playbook’s purpose. A “Get Started” button scrolls to the interactive table of contents. From there, users can jump to the Introduction, browse techniques, view examples, or open case studies directly. Users can also search keywords in the persistent search bar to jump straight to the content they need.

As users explore sections, call-out cards and collapsible panels guide them through each technique. In the Examples section, a toggle lets them compare initial prompts with refined versions side by side. Case studies show a narrative flow from problem description to prompt improvement results. At the end of any page, users can leave feedback, download the PDF, or use the sidebar index to navigate back to other parts of the playbook.

### 4. Core Features

*   **Interactive Techniques Library:** Collapsible panels detailing when and how to use each prompting method.
*   **Step-by-Step Examples:** Two-column layouts with before/after prompts, toggle comparison, and inline commentary.
*   **Case Study Showcase:** Full-page narratives showing initial prompts, revisions, AI outputs, and simple analysis charts.
*   **Search & Indexing:** Lunr.js powered keyword search with categorized suggestions and a right-hand index panel.
*   **Feedback & Analytics:** Disqus comment widget for reader feedback and Google Analytics for engagement tracking.
*   **Responsive Design & Branding:** Neutral blue/gray color scheme, sans-serif typography, minimal layout focusing on content.
*   **PDF Export:** One-click download of the entire playbook in printable PDF form.
*   **Version Control & Collaboration:** Hosted on GitHub Pages, editable in Replit, with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### 5. Tech Stack & Tools

Frontend: React for component-based UI, JavaScript/HTML/CSS for structure and styling, Lunr.js for client-side search.\
Static Hosting: GitHub Pages for deployment, GitHub Actions for build automation.\
Development & Collaboration: Replit as the online IDE, Git for version control.\
Analytics & Feedback: Google Analytics for page view tracking, Disqus for comments and discussion.

### 6. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Pages should load in under 2 seconds on average broadband. Use code splitting and lazy loading.
*   **Accessibility:** Follow WCAG AA standards for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and semantic markup.
*   **Security:** Serve over HTTPS, implement a Content Security Policy (CSP), and sanitize any user feedback.
*   **Scalability:** Static site should handle high traffic without extra infrastructure.

### 7. Constraints & Assumptions

*   The site is purely static; no server-side rendering beyond build time.
*   Lunr.js search works entirely in the browser, so index size must remain reasonable.
*   No user authentication or personalized content is required.
*   All source content lives in a GitHub repo and is edited via Replit or local clones.
*   PDF export uses a client-side library (e.g., jsPDF) and generates from the live content.

### 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **Large Search Index:** If too many entries are loaded, search may slow down. Mitigation: paginate or dynamically load indices.
*   **PDF Fidelity:** Client-side PDF generation may differ from on-screen layout. Mitigation: test carefully and adjust CSS for print media.
*   **Disqus Loading Time:** External scripts can slow initial page load. Mitigation: lazy-load Disqus widget after main content.
*   **Mobile Navigation:** Collapsible panels may be tricky on small screens. Mitigation: test and refine touch targets and panel behaviors.

## App Flow Document

### Onboarding and Sign-In/Sign-Up

Users arrive directly on the public website; there is no sign-up or sign-in process. A visitor can immediately explore the playbook without creating an account. Password recovery and authentication flows are not needed since the content is fully open. If a user wants to download a PDF version, they simply click the “Download PDF” button in the footer, which triggers a client-side file generation.

### Main Dashboard or Home Page

Once on the site, users see a header with the logo and navigation links: Introduction, Techniques, Examples, Case Studies, and Feedback. A hero banner briefly describes the playbook and a “Get Started” button scrolls the view to the interactive table of contents. The sidebar index on the right floats as users scroll, showing section progress and enabling quick jumps to any subsection.

### Detailed Feature Flows and Page Transitions

When a user clicks “Techniques,” the page displays a list of methods in collapsible panels. Clicking a panel expands it to show detailed descriptions and use cases. Navigation arrows appear at the bottom to move to the next or previous technique. In the “Examples” section, selecting an example opens a split view: the left shows the original prompt, the right shows the refined prompt and AI output. A toggle switch lets users highlight differences. Case studies are accessed from the “Case Studies” link, each opening as a full-page narrative. Users scroll through problem context, initial results, refined prompts, and analysis charts.

### Settings and Account Management

Because the site is public, there is no account or personal settings page. The only adjustable preference is a light/dark theme toggle in the header, which persists via localStorage. After changing the theme, users return to their previous scroll position automatically. The PDF download option also lives in the footer and does not interrupt navigation flow.

### Error States and Alternate Paths

If a page or section fails to load—due to lost connectivity or a missing file—the user sees a simple error message with a “Retry” button. For search queries that return no results, the search bar suggests related topics or prompts the user to broaden their keywords. Disqus comments load only after the main content appears; if the widget fails, a fallback message invites users to report the issue via GitHub Issues.

### Conclusion and Overall App Journey

From landing to learning, the user experiences a clear path: read the introduction, explore techniques, see practical refinements, and review case studies. The persistent navigation header and sidebar index keep users oriented. Throughout, they can leave feedback, switch themes, or download the PDF. This journey ensures the playbook is both educational and easy to traverse.

Everything aligns to ensure the playbook remains fast, secure, and easy to update.

## Frontend Guidelines Document

### Frontend Architecture

The site is built as a single-page React application. Components are organized into feature folders (e.g., Introduction, Techniques, Examples, CaseStudies). Each folder contains a main view component and any subcomponents (cards, panels, toggles). This structure promotes scalability: new techniques or sections translate into new folders without cluttering the core layout.

### Design Principles

We follow four key principles: 1) **Usability:** Clear labels, large click/tap targets, and straightforward navigation. 2) **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, ARIA roles for collapsible panels, and WCAG AA color contrast. 3) **Responsiveness:** Flexible grids and media queries ensure readability on phones, tablets, and desktops. 4) **Clarity:** Minimalist layouts keep focus on text and examples, avoiding distractions.

### Styling and Theming

We use CSS Modules (or styled-components) for scoped, maintainable styles. The default theme uses a neutral palette of blues (#2A5F8A) and grays (#333, #EEE). A dark theme inverts backgrounds and text for low-light environments. Typography relies on a simple sans-serif font (e.g., Helvetica or Arial) sized for readability. Print styles ensure the PDF version remains clean and well-formatted.

### Component Structure

Components are broken down into:

*   **Layout Components:** Header, Footer, Sidebar.
*   **Section Components:** IntroductionSection, TechniquesSection, ExamplesSection, CaseStudySection.
*   **UI Primitives:** Button, Card, Panel, ToggleSwitch.\
    This component-based approach encourages reusability, easier testing, and consistent styling across the site.

### State Management

Local component state handles UI interactions (e.g., which panel is open). A lightweight global store (React Context) manages theme preference and search results. We avoid heavy state libraries to keep the bundle small and the mental model simple.

### Routing and Navigation

React Router manages in-page anchors and URL hashes for deep linking to specific sections or examples. The main routes correspond to top-level sections ("/techniques", "/examples", "/case-studies"), and hash fragments scroll to individual items. Navigation links update the URL without full page reloads.

### Performance Optimization

We implement code splitting by section using React.lazy and Suspense, so users only download the code needed for the section they visit. Static assets like images and fonts are optimized and served with long cache lifetimes. Lunr.js index is dynamically imported to avoid blocking initial render.

### Testing and Quality Assurance

*   **Unit Tests:** Jest tests for pure functions and component snapshots.
*   **Integration Tests:** React Testing Library verifies user flows like panel expansion and PDF download.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Cypress scripts simulate navigation across sections, search behavior, and error fallbacks.
*   **Linting & Formatting:** ESLint and Prettier ensure code consistency.

### Conclusion and Overall Frontend Summary

These guidelines ensure the frontend remains modular, accessible, and high-performing. By combining React’s component model, scoped styling, and lightweight state management, we deliver a user-friendly playbook that’s easy to maintain and extend. The focus on accessibility, responsiveness, and performance aligns directly with the project’s educational goals.

6.  **Examples Section:** Build ExampleView with two-column layout, ToggleSwitch for side-by-side comparison, and inline commentary bubbles.
7.  **Case Studies Section:** Create CaseStudyPage template that renders narrative, before/after prompts, and a simple chart (SVG or Chart.js) for comparative metrics.
8.  **Search & Index:** Generate a Lunr.js index at build time. Add a SearchBar component with live suggestions and scroll-to-section behavior.
9.  **Feedback & Analytics:** Integrate Disqus widget with lazy loading. Add Google Analytics script and verify page view tracking.
10. **Theming & Responsiveness:** Implement theme toggle using React Context and CSS variables. Test responsive breakpoints and accessibility requirements.
11. **PDF Download:** Integrate jsPDF or html2pdf to capture the full document as PDF. Add a download button in the footer.
12. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Configure GitHub Actions to run lint, tests, and build on each push. Deploy successful builds to GitHub Pages automatically.
13. **Testing & QA:** Write and run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. Perform manual accessibility audits and performance profiling.
14. **Launch & Monitor:** Finalize content, merge to main branch, and notify users. Monitor analytics dashboards and Disqus feedback. Plan a roadmap for adding new techniques or case studies.

With these steps, the Prompt Engineering Playbook site will be ready for public release, easy to maintain, and scalable for future updates.
